# lndups
Hardlink duplicate files

Linux is the sole supported OS simply because I don't need it for another OS. It can be modified to be multiplatform though.


## Installation
`cargo install lndups` or `curl -O 'https://github.com/ascendforever/lndups/raw/refs/heads/main/prebuilt-x86-64-linux/lndups'`
